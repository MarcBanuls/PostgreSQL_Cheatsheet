# PostgreSQL_Cheatsheet

This is an attempt to create a cheatsheet (mainly for personal use) of the main commands and functions when using the PostgreSQL programming language. As I learn new commands or functions I will put them here and try to explain them in my words to have a great source of information in a quick glance. Due to being my first cheatsheet in R, the format will be changing from time to time a I am learning new techniques to have a more understandable format of visuals. If someone is interested in this cheatsheet and have a question or wants to add feedback do not hesitate in contacting me.

The cheatsheet right now is a number of things that I would like to remember in the futur, wihtout a defined format, so its better not to knit the rmd file yet.
I used at the moment the freecodecamp video introducing PostgreSQL as a guide, and I will revise and update the info with http://postgresguide.com/.
